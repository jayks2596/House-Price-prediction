# House-Price-prediction

In this research we built several machine learning models to predict the price of the houses.
The model used in our research were Linear regression, Neural network model using Keras
regression and Gradient Boost regression. We used R-square as the main metric to evaluate
the models and choose the model with the highest value for deployment. The computation
time for all the models were similar.
The Gradient Boost regression model proved to provide maximum accuracy when compared
to Keras regression model and Linear regression model.
The success of these models would predict the price of the houses and provide customer
satisfaction by preventing the risk of incorrect or faulty investment.
